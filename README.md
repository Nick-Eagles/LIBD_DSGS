# LIBD_DSGS

This repository contains code written to solve a problem brought up in a [Data Science Guidance Session](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/data-science-guidance-sessions.html) as part of my work at [LIBD](https://www.libd.org/). It is designed to serve as a reference, demonstrating a possible solution to a common problem or recurring task.

The repo is structured roughly after [these guidelines](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/organizing-your-work.html#project-documentation). While code is often written for a particular person and task, care is taken to not include personal information or absolute paths. This also keeps the code flexible and generalizable, encouraging re-use for similar tasks.
